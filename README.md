npm install --save-dev babel-cli

After that has concluded, the babel-cli field will have been added to the devDependencies object in
the package.json file: {
"devDependencies": {

"babel-cli": "^6.26.0"

}
}

npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015

Once the command finishes running, our package.json file will
contain another dependency: "devDependencies": {

"babel-cli": "^6.26.0",

"babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1"

}
